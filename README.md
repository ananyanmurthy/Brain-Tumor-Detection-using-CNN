# Brain-Tumor-Detection-using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify brain tumors from MRI images. A labeled dataset of MRI scans is used to train the model to distinguish between tumor and non-tumor cases. Steps include data loading, preprocessing, model building with Keras, training, and visualizing performance metrics.
